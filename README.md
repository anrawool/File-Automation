# File-Automation

## Abstract 
Everybody knows that File Automation or Automation in general is very satisfying. Normally, If I were to make a new folder, a project or just print a hardcopy of anything,
I would most probably opt for the long and boring process. Then I thought, why not automate all of that. 4 years of Python experience finally came into play.

## Project Purpose

Every project has a purpose. This is one's purpose is to make my life better. If enough people see it, more peoples' lives better.

## Project requirements:
1. Any version of python higher than 3.8 or 3.8 itself. Other python versions are not tested.
2. Terminal or Bash Access to File System

# Usage [Under Development]

There are some steps to making your life better. They are:
1. Clone this Repository
2. Install The requirements using `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` or `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the `setup.py` file
4. The entire project is setup and ready to go!!!

#### Warning: Do not execute functions from source code that start with a `_` in the `setup.py` file. If you are executing them and using them for modifications, please be aware of how to handle python programs. Without python knowledge it is not recommended to use those functions because they can cause damage to the computer if not executed properly.

## Manual Installation
If you are going for manual installation and do not want to give access to the python program to computer files, the steps will be uploaded soon...
